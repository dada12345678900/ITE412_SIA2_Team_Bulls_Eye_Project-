# Project Overview  

## 1. System Objectives  
The Scholarship Management System aims to streamline and automate the entire scholarship lifecycle — from application submission, review, award, and fund disbursement — while reducing manual work and minimizing errors. The system will:  
- Provide an intuitive online platform for students to apply and upload requirements.  
- Allow administrators and reviewers to efficiently evaluate applications using set criteria.  
- Ensure transparent communication with students through real-time status updates and notifications.  
- Track scholarship awards, disbursements, and renewal eligibility.  
- Improve efficiency, accuracy, and fairness in scholarship distribution.
